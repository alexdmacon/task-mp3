# task-mp3

# Summary:
For this assignment, we were asked to create a project that solves a real world problem in groups. In this project, our duties were to be devided amongst each other in the group while still working as a team, so in the end, our skills will come together in order to create something useful.
Using the list of criteria, our project had to use/include:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap

* Has to be interactive 

* Use at least two server side API's 

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or promts 

* Use client side storage to store persistent data 

* Be responsive 

* Have a polished UI

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards

* Have a quality ReadMe and be deployedto GitHub Pages


Our final result was this: <!-- Display the link to the project here -->



# Coming up with an Idea:
For our assignment, we were asked to use two different API's that went along with each other in order to create a full functioning appplication that a user can use. 

As a group, we began to brainstorm many differnet ideas that would not only be fun, but actually useful in a real life situation. Some of the ideas included:
- A Crime Database: A way to look up crime in your area.

- Songs and Movies: Look up a particular song and you'll have a list of movies that that particular song has appeared in. 

    - Even more movie ideas: Look up a movie and you will be presented with a trailer (This sounded very similar to what IMDB does so that idea was vetoed faster than all the other ones)

- Songs and The Weather: Bring up song ideas that was based on the weather, for example if its a rainy day, then the app will play "sad" music. 

And then finally, after awhile of brainstorming some cool and crazy ideas, we came up with this super cool, interactive app that will take the user through a quiz that will give them a task to do, along with a playlist to do that task with. 
    - for example: "As the user, I want to do something productive! (like read or work on homework), our app would provide a "chill beats" playlist that the user can listen to while doing this task.

A super cool idea that we all agreed on!

After getting a solid idea of what we wanted to do, we came up with a rough sketch that provided a basic outline of what our website is going to look like. 

<!-- We can insert the rough sketch here if y'all want -->


 From there, it seemed like we had a good place to start... 


# Got a cool project name?
Coming up with a super cool name for our project was our next task in mind after spending awhile with the brainstorming of project ideas, since our project had something to do with music, we wanted the title to have something "music related" in it, so we got names like:
- Do a task and get a song
- Sountrack ____________ or whatever
Turns out, we werent that creative with names, but at the end, we came up with a unique name that described our projects purpose. We came up with "Task.mp3"!


# A Change in Idea:
When starting to work on the project, we encountered a small problem with the music API that we were originally going to use, unfortunately, the API required a lot more work and authorizing in order for a playlist to actually be displayed, so we scrapped the idea and moved on to our next idea:
Instead of having a playlist being put out after the user takes the quiz, why not provide an actual video on how to do a certain task?

    - For example: The user wants to do something that "gets them out there", the app will provide a video on how to go Thift Shopping! 

And instead of having a quiz that the user has to go through, we narrowed it down to having one dropdown that will have a genre of differnt kinds of activities, for example: productive, relaxing, creative, etc. Then from there, the user will pick the type of activity and the app will provide a video to go along with that kind of task.

Okay, we have a super cool name that took us ages to come up with, now what? Since the team was very attatched to the name "Task.mp3" we figured it needed just a small change to it, so we came up with the even more creative name "Task.mp4"! 


# Getting started: 

* Working on the HTML: With working with the HTML, we based our structure on the sketch that we made for our project, the structure had to include:
    - A header with the title, a container where our dropdown menu and our submit button would be, a place where our YouTube video will be after the user picks an activity type, and a place where the past searches can be placed and of course, a footer where a creative group name will be placed.

    - While working on the project, the HTML had to be modified several times in order for it to start working with the JavaScript as well as the CSS. The ID's of the options listed for the dropdown were changed throughout working on the project in order to get everything working properly. 

<!-- Probably need to add more details about the HTML >




* Working with the CSS: <!-- Insert info on working on the CSS -->






* Wokring with the JavaScript: <!-- Insert info on working on the JavaScript -->
